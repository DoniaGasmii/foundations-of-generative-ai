# World Models and Generative World Modeling

**Generative world modeling** means using generative models to predict future states, observations, or dynamics of the world; not just classify or react, but **simulate what could happen next.**

> *For a high-level motivation and roadmap, see Yann LeCun’s 2025 lecture in Harvard on [Self-Supervised Learning, JEPA, and World Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUmDRxV0krg).*

> **LLMs are powerful—but they’re static libraries of facts.**  
> Human intelligence is **dynamic**:  
> - **Predictive**: we anticipate what happens *before* it does.  
> - **Integrative**: we fuse perception, memory, and knowledge into one coherent picture.  
> - **Adaptive**: we update our understanding when the world changes.  
> - **Multi-scale**: we reason across **time** (milliseconds to years) and **space** (local details to global context)—e.g., catching a ball (fast, local) *while* planning your day (slow, global).
